        Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects
        movement and coordination. It occurs due to the gradual loss of
        dopamine-producing neurons in a region of the brain called the
        substantia nigra. Dopamine is a critical neurotransmitter that helps
        regulate smooth, controlled movements. As dopamine levels drop,
        individuals experience symptoms like tremors, stiffness, slowness of
        movement, and difficulty with balance and coordination. Parkinson’s
        typically develops in people over 60 but can also occur earlier in some
        cases.

        The exact cause of Parkinson’s disease is unknown, but research suggests
        that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may contribute
        to its onset. Certain genetic mutations are linked to the disease, while
        exposure to toxins like pesticides and heavy metals has been associated
        with an increased risk. However, no specific trigger has been
        definitively identified. As the disease progresses, it can also affect
        non-motor functions, such as mood, sleep, and cognition, leading to a
        wide range of symptoms beyond just movement.

        While there is currently no cure for Parkinson's, treatments can help
        manage its symptoms. Medications like levodopa help replenish dopamine
        levels in the brain, and other therapies, such as deep brain
        stimulation, may offer relief for advanced cases. In addition to
        medication, physical therapy and lifestyle changes can improve mobility
        and quality of life. Ongoing research is aimed at developing new
        treatments and ultimately finding a cure for this debilitating
        condition.
