          Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that
          affects movement and coordination. It occurs due to the gradual loss
          of dopamine-producing neurons in a region of the brain called the
          substantia nigra. Dopamine is a critical neurotransmitter that helps
          regulate smooth, controlled movements. As dopamine levels drop,
          individuals experience symptoms like tremors, stiffness, slowness of
          movement, and difficulty with balance and coordination.

          The exact cause of Parkinsonâ€™s disease is unknown, but research
          suggests that a combination of genetic and environmental factors may
          contribute to its onset. Certain genetic mutations are linked to the
          disease, while exposure to toxins like pesticides and heavy metals has
          been associated with an increased risk. However, no specific trigger
          has been definitively identified.

          While there is currently no cure for Parkinson's, treatments can help
          manage its symptoms. Medications like levodopa help replenish dopamine
          levels in the brain, and other therapies, such as deep brain
          stimulation, may offer relief for advanced cases. In addition to
          medication, physical therapy and lifestyle changes can improve
          mobility and quality of life.
